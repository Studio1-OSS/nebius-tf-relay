/**
 * How much prior reasoning to replay on each turn.
 *
 * Every turn resends the conversation, and for a reasoning model that includes
 * the reasoning from earlier turns. On a long agentic session that is a large
 * and steadily growing share of the input tokens - which you pay for on every
 * subsequent turn. Some of it earns its keep (the model can follow its own
 * earlier chain); much of it is dead weight once a tool result has landed.
 *
 * - `full` (default): replay all prior reasoning, and let the model template
 *   keep it. Unchanged from previous releases.
 * - `interleaved`: replay prior reasoning but set `clear_thinking`, delegating
 *   active-turn retention to the model's own template.
 * - `off`: send no historical reasoning at all. Cheapest; the model sees only
 *   messages and tool results.
 *
 * Current-turn reasoning and live reasoning output are never affected.
